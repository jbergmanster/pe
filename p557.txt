Here are some of my thoughts on the problem.

The shape of the triangle with a given area does not affect the possible partitions.

With this we can create instances of right triagnes.

SPOILER - Below is my solution sketch. It is a bit messy because it uses explicit coordiantes.





Algorithm for a triangle of area Z.
Create a right triange with area Z as so.

Vertex A at the origin, (0,0)
Vertex B at (0,Z)
Vertex C at (2,0)

Since AB and AC are perpendicular .5 * 2 * Z = Z ( the area of the triangle)  

Add a point D starting at (0,1) to form the line CD and splitting the ABC triange into two triangles ACD and BCD.

I will move this point D up the Y axis to (0,z-1) to try all possible partitions of ACD and BCD. Those are the integer partions because BC is 2 so area =  
1/2 BC * AD = AD.

Next add a fifth point E on the X-axis between AC. And draw another line from C to E.

There is a sixth point F at the intersection of BD and CE
If both ABE and BDF are integral areas then it is a valid partition, meaning all the blocks four regions are integral.


To choose all the points E to consider work backwards from the area of ABE.

The area is just !/2 AB * AE or AE =  2 * area / AB

We have chosen E such that ABE is integral area. To get the area of BDF, we just need to find the x coordinate of the point F  by solving for the intersection of BF and CE.

With that the area of BDF is 1/2 * BD * x-coordinate of F. If this integral than it is a valid partion.

For a given triange area we need to iterate D from 1 to area - 1 up the y axis and E such that the area of ABE goes from  1 to area - 1.

So the algorithm is n^2 for a specific area to find all partitions.

So the overall solution is n^3
